This project is built based on my knowledge of weightlifting techniques and past injuries. The project is develope in Python, it integrates OpenCV, MediaPipe, and NumPy to analyze weightlifting form. It focuses on injury-prone areas such as the elbows, shoulders, wrists, hips, and knees. The project is structured as follows:

* Track elbow movement to prevent excessive motion and potential injury.
* Send alerts for improper shoulder, back, and knee positioning.
* Accurately calculate all necessary angles to provide comprehensive feedback and warnings.
* The application operates in real-time, providing instant feedback to users on their form and movement.

To use the application, you need to clone the repository. For the application to provide the most accurate feedback, position your camera to the side during your workout rather than the front.
